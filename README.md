# Next.js Link Component Routing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Next.js `Link` component, specifically unexpected routing behavior. The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected version.

## Problem
The original code uses the `Link` component to navigate between pages.  However, clicking the links may not produce the expected results due to incorrect configuration or improper usage of the component's `href` prop.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully checking the `href` prop values to ensure they accurately reflect the intended page routes within the Next.js application.
This often involves ensuring correct paths and handling dynamic routes properly.
